Include map scale speed
Slight randomness in particle colour
Have stretches of the path where the waterway parameters vary (e.g. deep part, shallow part)

Discharge = volume of waterway flow in m/s
Velocity = speed of waterway flow in m/s
Depth = depth of waterway in m
Width = width of waterway in m
Path distance = length of waterway in m



Visual representations:
Discharge = size of particle
Velocity = speed of particle
Animation velocity = speed of particle * 1000
Animation duration = length of waterway / animation velocity
Depth = darkness of particle
Width = width of waterway path


Typical values:
Discharge = 80 m^3/s
Velocity = 0.4 m/s
Depth = 5 m
Width = 100 m
Length = variable (2km for first example)
1km on map = 1000px


Procedure 1

1) Estimate the waterway length
2) Note waterway Velocity
3) Velocity * Length = Total time for animation
4) Set "Trace_Null" Trace Path keyframes to permit correctly timed loop and offset
5) First keyframe on 00:00 = 0%
6) Second keyframe on Total time for animation = 99.999%
7) Give second keyframe a Hold interpolation mode
8) Copy the first two keyframes and paste 1 frame later
9) "Trace_Null" duration irrelevent (but ensure is looping via script)
